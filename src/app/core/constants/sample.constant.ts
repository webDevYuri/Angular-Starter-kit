/**
 * Place your constant files in this folder.
 *
 * Constants define fixed values used across the application,
 * keeping magic strings and numbers in one centralized location.
 *
 * Examples:
 *   - api.constant.ts       → API base URLs and endpoint paths
 *   - regex.constant.ts     → reusable regex patterns for validation
 *   - app-config.constant.ts → default pagination size, date formats, etc.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   export const API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.example.com/v1';
 *
 *   export const REGEX = {
 *     EMAIL: /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/,
 *     PHONE: /^\+?[0-9]{10,15}$/,
 *   } as const;
 *
 * You can safely delete this file once you've added your own.
